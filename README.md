# DOM Katas

The purpose of this repo is to build a collection of small, self-contained challenges exploring the connection between JS, CSS and the DOM. 

There are many learning resrouces that set such exercises for javascript and other languages, but there seems to be very little that helps learners understand the application of javascript to the kinds of UIs prevelant in modern websites and apps.

The DOM is intimidating to begin to deal with, and this can be compounded by projects with too wide a scope. Following tutorials leads to good results, but tend not to provide a sense of accomplishment.

The aim is to create a library of challenges that can become increasingly complex - hopefully to the point where a student is capable of producing components to a professional standard. 

This should be a consideration when presenting our solutions. 

It may also be an idea to have 2 versions of each challenge - one version requires working to a written spec only, providing functional requirements and leaving design choices open to the user.

A second version supplements this with visual mockups, as if the graphical content had been provided by a web designer (this is just a thought at the time of writing).

## Initial list

- modal pop up box(es)
- contact card for email or phone client
- On hover, transition in content on div
